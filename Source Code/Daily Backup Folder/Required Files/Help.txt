Daily Backup Folder allows the user to select a folder which they wish to back up to another location, and then backs up that folder on a daily basis to the specified backup location.

If an existing backup folder is located in the specified location, then Daily Backup Folder simply copies over newer files than those already existing in the backed up location.
